                There are many different areas involved in music production and we would like to be part of them all with you, from preproduction to the final mixes and beyond. We know it can be very difficult for musicians to fund their own recording, given the modern music industry; so here at Penrose Music Production, we offer free preproduction and demoing to upcoming talent.
              </p>
              <p>
                Below is a breakdown of the different stages of music production and our role within them. You can of course, join us on any stage of the process. For example, if you have recordings you would like us to mix. However, we are always keen to meet musicians for preproduction, since it gives us the opportunity to understand what the final music should be.
              </p>

              <h3>Pre-Production</h3>
              <p>
                Preproduction is, to us, the most important stage of the production process, since it allows us to get to know you and your music better. 
                Much of it involves listening to your music, whether it is hearing you perform, attending a rehearsal session or going to a gig of yours. From this we want to together establish your musical and sonic direction and ambition. 
                We'd also like to have 'listening evenings' where we all get together (with snacks, and even BEER!) to listen to the music that influences you, that you just enjoy, and music we think you might like and might help further shape your vision. This gives us an opportunity to openly discuss what you want out of your recordings and how we will achieve them. 
                Later on in the process we can iron out the technical details such as song arrangement and the final tracking process, as well as administrative issues such as budgeting, timetabling and personnel.We see demoing as an important stage in getting your material out to listeners and developing your popularity. Demos by no means should be of poor quality, especially in the age of digital recording. Rather, we will strive to make demos of your music that are of excellent and commercial standard. We would encourage you to share these demos to build your fanbase and to gain the interest of labels and promoters, who may be able to help you further your career.We can record and mix demos at our home studio or on location if preferred. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <h3>Recording &amp; Overdubs</h3>
              <p>
                For recording a final album, EP or single, we prefer to use a professional recording studio, with a great selection of microphones and analog hardware. Being based in London, there is an amazing variety of studios for all budgets and requirements - the final choice will be something we discuss during preproduction. Naturally, we want to use the best studio for your music, particularly if it requires a specific sound or vibe, such as a great, natural sounding drum room. Overdubs can take place at the same studio or a smaller one, depending on what the project requires.

              <h3>Mixing &amp; Revisions</h3>
              <p>
                Mixing will take place either at our home studio or a professional mixing studio, depending what is required and preferred. Our discussions from preproduction will inform our mixing process and goals. We also prefer that you attend at least the latter section of the mixing stage, to make sure you are happy with the final music being delivered. This isn't possible for everyone, so we are happy to deliver mixes and revisions via email.

              <h3>Mastering</h3>
              <p>
                Penrose Music Productions does not perform professional mastering. We can provide 'faux' masters for listening purposes (i.e. mixes at CD loudness). While we are open to using any mastering engineer, we have a preferred mastering engineer: our friend Iain Andrew of Aria Mastering, who delivers excellent quality at very reasonable rates (£25 per track).
